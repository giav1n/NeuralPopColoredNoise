In this repositroy you can find the script for the numerical solution of the eigenvalue problem of 1 dimensional Fokker-Planck operator with natural boundary conditions. All the relevant function are located in "Lx.jl" while "SpectralQuantities.jl" shows how to use the scritp to compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a specific case.

Required packages:
* Plots,LaTeXStrings (For plots)
* QuadGK 
* Interpolations,Peaks
